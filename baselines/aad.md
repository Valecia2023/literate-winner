# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Key Terminology

The following are key terms and descriptions used in this document.

**Hybrid Azure Active Directory (AD)** – This term denotes the scenario
when an organization has an on-premises AD domain that contains the
master user directory but federates access to the cloud Microsoft 365
(M365) Azure AD tenant.

**Resource Tenant** – In scenarios where external users are involved
(e.g., guest users), the [resource tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/authentication-conditional-access)
hosts the M365 resources being used.

**Home Tenant** – In scenarios where external users are involved, the
[home tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/authentication-conditional-access)
is the one that owns the external user’s (e.g., guest) account.

## 1.2 Assumptions

The agency has created emergency access accounts in Azure AD and
implemented strong security measures to protect the credentials of those
accounts. Once created, those accounts should be placed into a group
named “Emergency Users” or a similar name. Throughout Microsoft’s
instructions, this entity is referred to as “emergency access or
break-glass accounts.” Use the following Microsoft guidance to create
and manage emergency access accounts.

[Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access)

The **License Requirements** sections of this document assume the
organization is using an [M365 E3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans)
or [G3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/government)
license level. Therefore, only licenses not included in E3/G3 are
listed.

## 1.3 Common guidance

### 1.3.1 Conditional Access Policies

This section provides common guidance that should be applied when
implementing baseline instructions related to Azure AD Conditional
Access policies.

As described in Microsoft’s instructions and examples related to
conditional access policies, CISA recommends setting a policy to
**Report-only** when it is created and then performing thorough hands-on
testing to ensure that there are no unintended consequences before
toggling the policy from **Report-only** to **On**. One tool that can
assist with running test simulations is the [What If tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/what-if-tool).
Microsoft also describes [Conditional Access insights and reporting features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting)
that can assist with testing.

### 1.3.2 Azure AD Privileged Identity Management

Some of the guidance in this baseline document leverages specific
features of the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) service to
demonstrate how to improve the security of highly privileged Azure AD
roles. The PIM service provides what is referred to as “Privileged
Access Management (PAM)” capabilities in industry. As an alternative to
Azure AD PIM, there are third-party vendors that provide products or
services with privileged access management capabilities that can be
leveraged if an agency chooses to do so.

# 2. Baseline

## 2.1 Legacy Authentication SHALL Be Blocked

Block legacy authentication protocols using a conditional access policy.
Legacy authentication does not support multifactor authentication (MFA),
which is required to minimize the impact of user credential theft.

### 2.1.1 Policy

- Legacy authentication SHALL be blocked.

### 2.1.2 Resources

- [Conditional Access: Block Legacy Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy)

- [Five steps to securing your identity infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/steps-secure-identity)

### 2.1.3 License Requirements

- N/A

### 2.1.4 Implementation

1.  Before blocking legacy authentication across the entire application
    base, follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication#identify-legacy-authentication-use)
    to determine if any of the agency’s existing applications are
    presently using legacy authentication. This helps develop a plan to
    address policy impacts.

2.  Follow [the instructions on this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy)
    to block legacy authentication. **Note:** The instructions suggest
    using Report-only mode which will not block legacy authentication.

## 2.2 High Risk Users SHALL Be Blocked

Azure AD Identity Protection uses various signals to detect the risk
level for each user and determine if an account has likely been
compromised. Users who are determined to be high risk are to be blocked
from accessing the system via Conditional Access until an administrator
remediates their account. Once a respective conditional access policy
with a block is implemented, if a high-risk user attempts to login, the
user will receive an error message with instructions to contact the
administrator to re-enable their access.

### 2.2.1 Policy

- Users detected as high risk SHALL be blocked.

- A notification SHOULD be sent to the administrator when high-risk
  users are detected.

### 2.2.2 Resources

- [Conditional Access: User risk-based Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk-user)

- [User experiences with Azure AD Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-user-experience)
  (Examples of how these policies are applied in practice)

- [Five steps to securing your identity infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/steps-secure-identity)

### 2.2.3 License Requirements

- Requires an AAD P2 license

### 2.2.4 Implementation

**Policy \#1:**

1.  To create the conditional access policy that implements the block
    for users at the risk level of High, follow the instructions in the
    [Enable with Conditional Access policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk-user#enable-with-conditional-access-policy)
    section, but set the policy to block access as follows:

2.  Under **Access Controls** -\> **Grant**, select **Block access**.

**Policy \#2**:

1.  Follow the instructions in the [Configure users at risk detected alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-notifications#configure-users-at-risk-detected-alerts)
    section to configure Azure AD Identity Protection to email the
    security operations team/administrator when a user account is
    determined to be high risk so that they can review and respond to
    threats.

## 2.3 High Risk Sign-ins SHALL Be Blocked

Azure AD Identity Protection uses various signals to detect the risk
level for each user sign-in. Sign-ins detected as high risk are to be
blocked via Conditional Access.

### 2.3.1 Policy

Sign-ins detected as high risk SHALL be blocked.

### 2.3.2 Resources

- [Conditional Access: Sign-in risk-based Conditional
  Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk)

- [Sign-in
  risk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#sign-in-risk)

- [User experiences with Azure AD Identity
  Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-user-experience)
  (Examples of how these policies are applied in practice)

### 2.3.3 License Requirements

- Requires an AAD P2 license

### 2.3.4 Implementation

To create the conditional access policy that implements the block for
sign-ins at the risk level of **High**, follow the instructions in the
[Enable with Conditional Access
policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk#enable-with-conditional-access-policy)
section, but set the risk level to **High** and block access.

1.  Under **Select the sign-in risk level this policy will apply to**,
    select **High.**

2.  Under **Access Controls** -\> **Grant**, select **Block access.**

**Note**: If after implementing this, it is observed that numerous
legitimate user sign-ins are consistently being blocked due to their
location being interpreted as suspicious and this creates an operational
burden on the agency, then [a Trusted Location can be
configured](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/location-condition#ip-address-ranges)
in the Conditional Access blade for each of the legitimate sign-in
locations. Azure AD Identity Protection considers the Trusted Location
data when it calculates sign-in risk, and this may help to prevent users
signing in from legitimate locations from being flagged as high risk.

## 2.4 Phishing-Resistant Multifactor Authentication SHALL Be Required for All Users

Phishing-resistant multifactor authentication protects against
sophisticated phishing attacks. Recognizing the significant risk these
attack present, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), requires
federal agencies to [implement phishing-resistant
authentication](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf).

However, phishing-resistant MFA may not always be immediately available,
especially on mobile devices. Where phishing-resistant MFA is not yet
available, organization should adopt an MFA method from the list below.
Organizations must upgrade to a phishing-resistant MFA method as soon as
possible to become compliant with this policy and address the critical
security threat posed by modern phishing attacks.

**Note**: Figure adapted from [MS Build
Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods)
article (12/29/2021).

alt="Weak MFA (SMS/Voice) Stronger MFA (Push Notifications, Software OTP, Hardware Token OTP) Strongest MFA (FIDO2, PIV, Windows Hello)" />

Figure 1: Options for Weak MFA, Stronger MFA Options, and Strongest MFA

### 2.4.1 Policy

- MFA SHALL be required for all users.

- Phishing-resistant MFA SHALL be used for all users.

  - Phishing-resistant methods:

    - Federal PIV card (Azure AD Certificate-Based authentication
      \[CBA\])

    - FIDO2 Security Key

    - Windows Hello for Business

    - Federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card (Federated from
      agency Active Directory or other identity provider)

- If phishing-resistant MFA cannot be used, an MFA method from the list
  below SHALL be used in the interim:

  - Microsoft Authenticator (Push Notifications)

  - Microsoft Authenticator (Phone Sign-in) (Also referred to as
    Passwordless Sign-in)

    - When using Microsoft Authenticator:

      - Number Matching SHALL be enabled.

      - Additional Context SHALL be enabled.

  - Software Tokens One-Time Password (OTP) – This option is commonly implemented using mobile phone authenticator apps

  - Hardware tokens OTP

- SMS or Voice as the MFA method SHALL NOT be used.

### 2.4.4 Implementation

**Policy \#1:**

1.  Follow [these
    instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa)
    to create a conditional access policy that requires all users to
    authenticate with MFA.

**Policy \#2:**

Use the following instructions to configure a phishing-resistant MFA
method for users with highly privileged roles. If the agency is
configuring a phishing-resistant MFA method for all users, then the
instructions in this section also apply, but set the **Target** to **All
Users** instead of a specific group in the respective configuration
screens.

CISA recommends placing highly privileged users into an Azure AD group
named “Highly Privileged Admins” or an equivalent and then referencing
the group in the MFA configuration. Newly created, highly privileged
users should be added to the group so they can register a
phishing-resistant method. CISA does not recommend assigning MFA methods
directly to individual users.

Select one of the following phishing-resistant MFA methods to configure:

**FIDO2 Security Key**

1.  Follow the instructions at [this

    session** to **Never persistent.**

## 2.11 The Number of Users with the Highest Privilege Roles SHALL Be Limited

Global Administrator is the highest privileged role in Azure AD because
it provides unfettered access to the tenant. Therefore, if a user’s
credential with these permissions were to be compromised, it would
present grave risks to the security of the tenant. Limit the number of
users that are assigned the role of Global Administrator. Assign users
to finer-grained administrative roles that they need to perform their
duties instead of being assigned the Global Administrator role.

### 2.11.1 Policy

- A minimum of two users and a maximum of four users SHALL be
  provisioned with the Global Administrator role.

5.  Review the score for the action named **Use limited administrative
    roles.**

6.  Ensure that the maximum score was achieved, and that the status is
    **Completed.**

7.  If the maximum score was not achieved, click the improvement action
    and Microsoft provides a pop-up page with detailed instructions on
    how to address the weakness. In short, to address the weakness,
    assign users to finer grained roles (e.g., SharePoint Administrator,
    Exchange Administrator) instead of Global Administrator. Only the
    minimum number of users necessary should be assigned to Global
    Administrator. Once the roles are reassigned according to the
    guidance, check the score again after 48 hours to ensure compliance.

## 2.12 Highly Privileged User Accounts SHALL Be Cloud-Only

Assign users that need to perform highly privileged tasks to cloud-only
Azure AD accounts to minimize the collateral damage of an on-premises
identity compromise.[^1]

### 2.12.1 Policy

- Users that need to be assigned to highly privileged Azure AD roles
  SHALL be provisioned cloud-only accounts that are separate from the
  on-premises directory or other federated identity providers.

- The following built-in Azure AD roles are considered highly privileged
  at a minimum. Additional built-in roles that are considered highly
  privileged in the agency’s environment can be added to this list:

  - Global Administrator

  - Privileged Role Administrator

  - User Administrator

  - SharePoint Administrator

  - Exchange Administrator

  - Hybrid Identity Administrator

  - Application Administrator

  - Cloud Application Administrator

- [Securing privileged access for hybrid and cloud deployments in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/security-planning#ensure-separate-user-accounts-and-mail-forwarding-for-global-administrator-accounts)

### 2.12.3 License Requirements

- N/A

### 2.12.4 Implementation

Review [these](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/view-assignments)
instructions to identify users assigned to highly privileged roles and
verify the account does not exist outside Azure AD.

## 2.13 Multifactor Authentication SHALL Be Required for Highly Privileged Roles

Require users to perform MFA to access highly privileged roles. This
configuration provides a backup policy to enforce MFA for highly
privileged users in case the main conditional access policy—which
requires MFA for all users—is disabled or misconfigured.

### 2.13.1 Policy

- MFA SHALL be required for user access to highly privileged roles.

<!-- -->

- Refer to the baseline statement [Highly Privileged User Accounts SHALL
  be Cloud-Only](#2.12.1 Policy)
  for a recommended minimum list of Azure AD built-in roles that are
  considered highly privileged. It is also possible to designate
  additional built-in roles that are considered highly privileged in the
  agency’s environment based on its risk tolerance.

### 2.13.2 Resources

- [M-22-09 Federal Zero Trust Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf)

### 2.13.3 License Requirements

- N/A

### 2.13.4 Implementation

[Follow these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa)
to create a conditional access policy requiring MFA for access, but
under **Assignments,** use the following tailored steps to scope the
policy to privileged roles.

1.  Under **Assignments**, select **Users and groups.**

<!-- -->

2.  Under **Include**, choose **Select users and groups**, then click
    the **Directory roles** checkbox. Select each of the roles listed in
    the baseline statement, [Highly Privileged User Accounts SHALL be Cloud-Only](#2121-Policy).

3.  Under **Exclude**, follow Microsoft’s guidance from the previously
    provided instructions link.

## 2.14 Users Assigned to Highly Privileged Roles SHALL NOT Have Permanent Permissions 

Do not assign users to highly privileged roles using permanent active
role assignments. Instead, assign users to eligible role assignments in
a PAM system and provide an expiration period for active assignments
requiring privileged users to reactivate their highly privileged roles
upon expiration.

**Note**: Although Azure AD PIM is referenced in the implementation
instructions, an equivalent third-party PAM service may be used instead.

### 2.14.1 Policy

- Permanent active role assignments SHALL NOT be allowed for highly
  privileged roles. Active assignments SHALL have an expiration period.
  - Refer to the baseline statement, [Highly Privileged User Accounts SHALL be Cloud-Only](#2121-Policy),
  for a recommended minimum list of Azure AD built-in roles that are
  considered highly privileged. It is also possible to designate
  additional built-in roles that are considered highly privileged in the
  agency’s environment based on its risk tolerance.

<!-- fix-->

- Provisioning of users to highly privileged roles SHALL NOT occur
  outside of a PAM system, such as the Azure AD PIM service, because
  this bypasses the controls the PAM system provides.

### 2.14.2 Resources

- [Assign Azure AD roles in Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user)

### 2.14.3 License Requirements

- Use of an Azure AD PIM or an equivalent third-party PAM service.

- Azure AD PIM requires an AAD P2 license

### 2.14.4 Implementation

Note: Any parts of the following implementation instructions that
reference the Azure AD PIM service will vary if using a third-party PAM
system.

1.  In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to **Azure AD Privileged Identity
    Management (PIM).**

<!-- -->

2. Under **Manage**, select **Azure AD roles**.

3. Under **Manage**, select **Roles**. This should bring up a list of
    all the Azure AD roles managed by the PIM service.

4. **Note**: This step is specific to the first policy bullet.
    Repeat this step and step 5 for each highly privileged role
    referenced in the policy section. The role “Global Administrator” is
    used as an example in these instructions.

<!-- fix -->
  1.  Click the **Global Administrator** role in the list.
  2.  Click **Settings**.
  3.  Click **Edit.**
  4.  Select the **Assignment** tab.
  5.  De-select the option named **Allow permanent active assignment.**
  6.  Under **Expire active assignments after**, select **15 days**.
  7.  Click **Update.**

<!-- -->

5. Note: This step is specific to the second policy bullet.

<!-- fix-->

  1.  While on the **Assignments** page for the role, select the **Active
    Assignments** tab.
  2.  Review the assignments list. If any of the assignments show a
    **Start time** of “-” (i.e., empty start time) and of **End time**
    of **Permanent**, then those role assignments were made outside of
    the PIM service and therefore are out of compliance with the policy.
  3.  Delete the non-compliant role assignments and then recreate them
    using the PIM service.

<!-- -->

6. In addition to checking for permanent assignments using the PIM
    Assignments page in step \#5, PIM also provides a report that lists
    all role assignments that were performed outside of PIM so that
    those assignments can be deleted and properly recreated using PIM.

<!-- -->

  1.  From the **PIM landing page**, under **Manage**, select **Azure AD
    roles.**
  2.  Under **Manage**, select **Alerts.**
  3.  Click the **Scan** button and wait for the scan to complete.
  4.  If there were any roles assigned outside of PIM, the report will
    display an alert named, **Roles are being assigned outside of
    Privileged Identity Management**; Click that alert.
  5.  PIM displays a list of users, their associated roles, and the
    date/time that they were assigned a role outside of PIM: Delete the
    non-compliant role assignments and then recreate them using the PIM
    service.

## 2.15 Activation of Highly Privileged Roles SHOULD Require Approval

Require approval for a user to activate a highly privileged role, such
as Global Administrator. This makes it more challenging for an attacker
to leverage the stolen credentials of highly privileged users and
ensures that privileged access is monitored closely.

**Note**: Although Azure AD PIM is referenced in the implementation
instructions, an equivalent third-party PAM service may be used instead.

### 2.15.1 Policy

- Activation of highly privileged roles SHOULD require approval

<!-- -->

- Refer to the baseline statement [Highly Privileged User Accounts SHALL be Cloud-Only](#2121-Policy)
  for a list of Azure AD built-in roles that are considered highly
  privileged. It is also possible to configure additional built-in roles
  that are considered highly privileged in the agency’s environment
  based on its risk tolerance.

### 2.15.2 Resources

- [Approve or deny requests for Azure AD roles in Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/azure-ad-pim-approval-workflow)

### 2.15.3 License Requirements

- Use an Azure AD PIM or an equivalent third-party PAM service

- Azure AD PIM requires an AAD P2 license

### 2.15.4 Implementation

**Note**: Any parts of the following implementation instructions that
reference the Azure AD PIM service will vary if using a third-party PAM
system.

1.  In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to **Azure AD** and create a new
    group named “Privileged Escalation Approvers.” This group will
    contain users that will receive role activation approval requests
    and approve or deny them. Users in this group must, at least, have
    the permissions provided to the Privileged Role Administrators role
    to adjudicate requests.

2.  In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to **Azure AD Privileged Identity
    Management (PIM).**

<!-- -->

3. Under **Manage**, select **Azure AD roles**.

4. Under **Manage**, select **Roles**. This should bring up a list of
    all the Azure AD roles managed by the PIM service.

5. Repeat this step for the Privileged Role Administrator role, User
    Administrator role, and other roles that the agency has designated
    as highly privileged.

<!-- -->

  1.  Click the **Global Administrator** role in the list.
  2.  Click **Settings.**
  3.  Click **Edit**.
  4.  Select the **Require approval to activate** option.
  5.  Click **Select approver**s, select the group **Privileged Escalation
    Approvers**, and then click **Select**.
  6.  Click **Update**.

## 2.16 Highly Privileged Role Assignment and Activation SHALL Be Monitored

Since many cyber attacks leverage privileged access, it is imperative to
closely monitor the assignment and activation of the highest privileged
roles for signs of compromise. Create alerts to trigger when a highly
privileged role is assigned to a user and when a user activates a highly
privileged role.

Note: Although Azure AD PIM is referenced in the implementation
instructions, an equivalent third-party PAM service may be used instead.

### 2.16.1 Policy

- Eligible and Active highly privileged role assignments SHALL trigger
  an alert.

<!-- -->

  - Refer to the baseline statement [Highly Privileged User Accounts SHALL be Cloud-Only](#2121-Policy)
  for a recommended minimum list of Azure AD built-in roles that are
  considered highly privileged. It is also possible to designate
  additional built-in roles that are considered highly privileged in the
  agency’s environment based on its risk tolerance.

<!-- -->

- User activation of the Global Administrator role SHALL trigger an
  alert.

- User activation of other highly privileged roles SHOULD trigger an
  alert.

<!-- -->

  - Note: Alerts can be configured for user activation of other highly
  privileged roles as well but note that if users activate these other
  roles frequently, it can prompt a significant number of alerts.
  Therefore, for those other roles, it might be prudent to set up a
  separate monitoring mailbox from the one configured for the alerts
  associated with the Global Administrator role. This separate mailbox
  would be designed to store alerts for “review as necessary” purposes
  versus the mailbox configured for the Global Administrator role, which
  should be monitored closely since that role is sensitive.

### 2.16.2 Resources

- [Assign Azure AD roles in Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user)

### 2.16.3 License Requirements

- Use an Azure AD PIM or an equivalent third-party PAM service.

- Azure AD PIM requires an AAD P2 license

### 2.16.4 Implementation

Note: Any parts of the following implementation instructions that
reference the Azure AD PIM service will vary if using a third-party PAM
system.

1.  In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to **Azure AD Privileged Identity
    Management (PIM).**

<!-- -->

2. Under **Manage**, select A**zure AD roles.**

3. Under **Manage**, select **Roles**. This should bring up a list of
    all the Azure AD roles managed by the PIM service.

4. Click the **Global Administrator** role.

5. Click **Settings** and then click **Edit.**

6. Click the **Notification** tab.

7. Under **Send notifications when members are assigned as eligible to
    this role**, in the **Role assignment alert** -\> **Additional
    recipients** textbox, enter the email address of the mailbox
    configured to receive the alerts for this role.

8. Under S**end notifications when members are assigned as active to
    this role**, in the **Role assignment alert** -\> **Additional
    recipients** textbox, enter the email address of the mailbox
    configured to receive the alerts for this role.

9. Under **Send notifications when eligible members activate this
    role**, in the **Role activation alert** -\> **Additional
    recipients** textbox, enter the email address of the mailbox
    configured to receive the alerts for this role.

10. Click **Update**.

11. Repeat steps 4 through 10 for each of the other highly privileged
    roles referenced in the policy section above, with one modification:

<!-- -->

  1.  When configuring the **Send notifications when eligible members
    activate this role** for these other roles, enter an email address
    of a mailbox that is different from the one used to monitor Global
    Administrator activations.

## 2.17 Managed Devices SHOULD Be Required for Authentication 

Require that users connect to M365 from a device that is managed using
conditional access. Agencies that are implementing a hybrid Azure AD
environment will likely use the conditional access control option named
**Hybrid Azure AD joined**, whereas agencies that are using devices that
connect directly to the cloud and do not join an on-premises AD will use
the conditional access control option named, **Require device to be
marked as compliant**.

**Guest user access note**: This conditional access policy will impact
guest access to the tenant because guest users will be required to
authenticate from a managed device similar to regular Azure AD users.
For guest users, the organization that manages their home tenant is
responsible for managing their devices and the resource tenant must be
configured to trust the device claims from the home tenant, otherwise
guest users will be blocked by the policy. [This link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/authentication-conditional-access) describes the
detailed authentication flow for guest users and how conditional access
related to devices is applied.
The implementation section describes the cross-tenant settings that must
be configured in both the home and the resource tenants to facilitate
guest access with managed devices.

### 2.17.1 Policy

- Managed devices SHOULD be required for authentication.

### 2.17.2 Resources

- [Configure hybrid Azure AD join](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-hybrid-azure-ad-join)

- [Azure AD joined devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join)

- [Set up enrollment for Windows devices (for Intune)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enroll)

### 2.17.3 License Requirements

- Use Microsoft Intune (if implementing the requirement for the device
  to be compliant).

### 2.17.4 Implementation

[Follow these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device#create-a-conditional-access-policy)
to create a conditional access policy that requires the device to be
either hybrid Azure AD joined or compliant during authentication.

Use the following instructions to facilitate guest access with managed
devices. Although the agency implementing this baseline only controls
the resource tenant and does not have control over the home tenant, CISA
provides our recommended security configuration for the home tenant in
this section.

Reference [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview)
for a general description of cross-tenant access settings to become
familiar with the terminology and configurations.

For the resource tenant, use the following steps (for demonstration
purposes, the home tenant domain is named “home.onmicrosoft.com” —
replace this name with the actual name of the tenant):

<!-- -->

1.  Navigate to **Azure AD** -\> **External Identities** -\>
    **Cross-tenant access settings.**

<!-- -->

2.  In **Organizational Settings**, add a new organization –
    “home.onmicrosoft.com”.

3.  Open the **Inbound access** settings for the newly added
    organization.

4.  Click the **B2B collaboration** tab. Under **External users and
    Groups** -\> **Access status**, select **Allow access.**

5.  Under **External users and Groups** -\> **Applies to**, select **All
    external users and groups.**

6.  Click the **Trust settings** tab. Under **Customize settings** -\>
    select **Trust multi-factor authentication from Azure AD tenants**,
    **Trust compliant devices,** and **Trust hybrid Azure AD joined
    devices**

<!-- -->

For the home tenant, use the following steps (for demonstration
purposes the resource tenant domain is named
“resource.onmicrosoft.com” — replace this name with the actual name
of the tenant):

<!-- -->

1.  Navigate to **Azure AD** -\> **External Identities** -\>
    **Cross-tenant access settings.**

<!-- -->

2.  In **Organizational Settings**, Add a new organization –
    “resource.onmicrosoft.com”.

3.  Open the **Outbound access** settings for the newly added
    organization.

4.  Click the **B2B collaboration** tab. Under **Users and Groups** -\>
    **Access status**, select **Allow access.**

5.  Under **Users and Groups** -\> **Applies to**, select **All users.**

## 2.18 Guest User Access SHOULD Be Restricted

Ensure that only users with specific privileges can invite guest users
to the tenant and that invites can only be sent to specific external
domains. Also ensure that guest users have limited access to Azure AD
directory objects.

### 2.18.1 Policy

- Only users with the Guest Inviter role SHOULD be able to invite guest
  users.

- Guest invites SHOULD only be allowed to specific external domains that
  have been authorized by the agency for legitimate business purposes.

- Guest users SHOULD have limited access to Azure AD directory objects.

### 2.18.2 Resources

### 2.18.4 Implementation

[Follow these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/external-collaboration-settings-configure#configure-settings-in-the-portal)
to configure the Azure AD **External collaboration settings**.

1.  Under **Guest user access**, select **Guest users have limited
    access to properties and memberships of directory objects.**

2.  Under **Guest invite settings**, select **Only users assigned to
    specific admin roles can invite guest users**.

3.  Under **Collaboration restrictions**, select **Allow invitations
    only to the specified domains (most restrictive)**.

<!-- -->

4.  Select **Target domains** and enter the names of the external
    domains that have been authorized by the agency for guest user
    access.

# Appendix A: Hybrid Azure AD Guidance

The majority of this document does not focus on securing hybrid Azure AD
environments. CISA is working on a separate document that addresses the
unique implementation requirements of hybrid Azure AD infrastructure,
including the on-premises components. Meanwhile, the following limited
set of hybrid Azure AD policies that include on-premises components are
provided:

- Azure AD Password Protection SHOULD be implemented for the on-premises
  directory.

<!-- -->

- [Enforce on-premises Azure AD Password Protection for Active Directory Domain Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad-on-premises)

- [Plan and deploy on-premises Azure Active Directory Password Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-ban-bad-on-premises-deploy)

<!-- -->

- Password hash synchronization with the on-premises directory SHOULD be
  implemented.

<!-- -->

- [Implement password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization)

<!-- -->

- Service accounts created in Azure AD to support the integration of
  Azure AD Connect SHOULD be restricted to originate from the IP address
  space of the network hosting the on-premises AD. This can be
  implemented via a conditional access policy that is applied to the
  Azure AD Connect service accounts and blocks access except from a
  specific Azure AD Named Location that is configured with respective
  on-premises IP address range.

<!-- -->

- [Using the location condition in a Conditional Access policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/location-condition)

- [Azure AD Connect: Accounts and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-accounts-permissions)

[^1]: “Cloud-only” user accounts have no ties to the on-premises AD and
    are not federated – they are local to Azure AD only.
