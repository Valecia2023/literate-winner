# Introduction

Microsoft Teams is a text and live chat workspace in Microsoft 365 that
supports video calls, chat messaging, screen-sharing, and file sharing.
It has a permission-based team structure for managing calls and files.
Microsoft teams also enables teams to manage their own user access
rights, security policies, and record video calls.

Access to Teams can be controlled by the user type. In this baseline,
the types of users are defined as follows (Note: these terms vary in use
across Microsoft documentation):

1.  **Internal users**: members of the agency’s M365 tenant.

2.  **External users**: members of a different M365 tenant.

3.  **Business to Business** (B2B) guest users: external users that are
    formally invited to collaborate with the team and added to the
    agency’s Azure Active Directory (AAD) as guest users. These users
    authenticate with their home organization/tenant and are granted
    access to the team by virtue of being listed as guest users on the
    tenant’s AAD.

4.  **Unmanaged users**: users who are not members of any M365 tenant or
    organization (e.g., personal Microsoft accounts).

5.  **Anonymous users**: Teams users joining calls that are not
    authenticated through the agency’s tenant, including unmanaged
    users, external users (except for B2B guests), and true anonymous
    users, meaning users that are not logged in to any Microsoft or
    organization account, such as dial-in users.[^1]

## Assumptions

The **License Requirements** sections of this document assume the
organization is using an [M365
E3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans)
or [G3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/government)
license level. Therefore, only licenses not included in E3/G3 are
listed.

# Baseline

## 1. Requesting Control of Shared Desktops or Windows

This setting controls whether external meeting participants can request
control of the shared desktop or window during the meeting. In this
instance, the term “external participants” includes external users, B2B
guest users, unmanaged users and anonymous users.

### Policies

#### MS.TEAMS.1.1v1
External participants SHOULD NOT be enabled to request control of shared desktops or windows in the Global (Org-wide default) meeting policy or in custom meeting policies if any exist.

- _Rationale:_ While there is some inherent risk in granting an external participant
control of a shared screen, legitimate use cases for this exist.
Furthermore, the risk is minimal as users cannot gain control of another
user’s screen unless the user giving control explicitly accepts a
control request. As such, while enabling external participants to
request control is discouraged, it may be done, depending on agency
need.

5.  If custom policies have been created, repeat these steps for each
    policy, selecting the appropriate policy in step 3.

## 2. Starting Teams Meetings

This setting controls which meeting participants can start a meeting. In
this instance, the term “anonymous users” refers to any Teams users
joining calls that are not authenticated through the agency’s tenant.

### Policies

#### MS.TEAMS.2.1v1
Anonymous users SHALL NOT be enabled to start meetings in the Global (Org-wide default) meeting policy or in custom meeting policies if any exist.

### Resources
- [Meeting policy settings - Participants & guests \| Microsoft
  Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/meeting-policies-participants-and-guests)

### License Requirements
- N/A

### Implementation
To configure settings for automatic meeting admittance:

1.  Sign in to the [**Microsoft Teams admin
    center**](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).

2.  Select **Meetings -\>** **Meeting** **policies**.

3.  Select the **Global (Org-wide default)** policy.

    **Automatically admit people** is *not* set to **Everyone**.

5.  In the same section, set **Dial-in users can bypass the lobby** to
    **Off**.

6.  If custom policies have been created, repeat these steps for each
    policy, selecting the appropriate policy in step 3.

## 4. External User Access

External access allows external users to look up internal users by their
email address to initiate chats and calls entirely within Teams.
Blocking external access prevents external users from using Teams as an
avenue for reconnaissance or phishing. Even with external access
disabled, external users will still be able to join Teams calls,
assuming anonymous join is enabled. Depending on agency need, if both
external access and anonymous join need to be blocked—neither required
nor recommended by this baseline—external collaborators would only be
able to attend meetings if added as a B2B guest user.

External access may be granted on a per-domain basis. This may be
desirable in some cases, e.g., for agency-to-agency collaboration (see
the CIO Council's [Interagency Collaboration
Program](https://community.max.gov/display/Egov/Interagency+Collaboration+Program)’s
OMB Max Site for a list of .gov domains for sharing).

Importantly, this setting only pertains to external users (i.e., members
of a different M365 tenant). Access for unmanaged users is controlled
separately.

### Policies

#### MS.TEAMS.4.1v1
External access SHALL only be enabled on a per-domain basis.

4.  Click **Allow domains** to add allowed external domains. All domains
    not added in this step will be blocked.

5.  Click **Save.**

## 5. Unmanaged User Access

Blocking contact with unmanaged Teams users prevents these users from
looking up internal users by their email address and initiating chats
and calls within Teams. These users would still be able to join calls,
assuming anonymous join is enabled. Additionally, unmanaged users may be
added to Teams chats if the internal user initiates the contact.

3.  Under **Skype** users, set **Allow users in my organization to
    communicate with Skype users** to **Off**.

4.  Click **Save**.

## 7. Teams Email Integration

Teams provides an optional feature that allows channels to have an email
address and receive email. These channel email addresses are not under
the tenant’s domain; rather, they are associated with a Microsoft-owned
domain, teams.ms. As such, although some basic checks are performed,
agencies do not have control over the security settings associated with
this email. For this reason, email channel integration should be
disabled.

### Policies
#### MS.TEAMS.7.1v1
Teams email integration SHALL be disabled.
- _Rationale:_ TODO
- _Last modified:_ July 2023

### Resources

- [Email Integration \| Microsoft
Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/enable-features-office-365#email-integration)

## 8. App Management

Teams is capable of integrating with the following classes of apps:

*Microsoft apps*: apps published by Microsoft.

*Third-party apps*: apps not authored by Microsoft, published to the
Teams store.

*Custom apps*: apps not published to the Teams store, such as apps under
development, that users “sideload” into Teams.

    policy, selecting the appropriate policy in step 3.

## 9. Cloud Recording of Teams Meetings

This setting determines whether video can be recorded in meetings hosted
by a user, during one-on-one calls, and on group calls started by a
user. Agencies should comply with any other applicable policies or
legislation in addition to this guidance.

### Policies

#### MS.TEAMS.9.1v1
Cloud video recording SHOULD be disabled in the global (org-wide default) meeting policy.

## 11. Data Loss Prevention

Data loss prevention (DLP) helps prevent both accidental leakage of
sensitive information as well as intentional exfiltration of data. DLP
forms an integral part of securing Microsoft Teams. There a several
commercial DLP solutions available that document support for Microsoft
Teams. Agencies may select any service that fits their needs and meets
the requirements outlined in this baseline control.

Microsoft offers DLP services, controlled within the [Microsoft 365
compliance](https://compliance.microsoft.com) admin center. Though use
of Microsoft’s DLP solution is not strictly required, guidance for
configuring Microsoft’s DLP solution can be found in the “Data Loss
Prevention SHALL Be Enabled” section of the *Defender for Office 365
Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline*. The DLP solution selected
by an agency should offer services comparable to those offered by
Microsoft.

### Policies

#### MS.TEAMS.11.1v1
A DLP solution SHALL be enabled.
- _Rationale:_ TODO

## 13. Link Protection

Microsoft Defender protects users from malicious links included in Teams
messages by prepending

`https://\*.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=`

to URLs included in the messages. By prepending the safe links URL,
Microsoft can proxy the initial URL through their scanning service.
Their proxy performs the following checks:

- Compares the URL with a block list

- Compares the URL with a list of know malicious sites

- If the URL points to a downloadable file, applies real-time file
scanning

- If all checks pass, the user is redirected to the original URL.

Though Defender’s use is not strictly required for this purpose,
guidance for enabling link scanning using Microsoft Defender is included
in the “Safe Links Policies SHALL Be Enabled” and “Safe Links in Global
Settings SHALL be Configured” sections of the *Defender for Office 365
Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline.*
