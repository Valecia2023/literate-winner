# Introduction

Microsoft 365 Defender is a cloud-based enterprise defense suite that
coordinates prevention, detection, investigation, and response. This set
of tools and features are used to detect many types of attacks.

This baseline focuses on the features of Defender for Office 365 and
some settings are in fact configured in the [Microsoft 365
compliance](https://compliance.microsoft.com) admin center. However, for
simplicity, both the Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft 365 compliance
admin center items are contained in this baseline.

Generally, use of Microsoft Defender is not required by the baselines of
the core M365 products (Exchange Online, Teams, etc.). However, some of
the controls in the core baselines require the use of a dedicated
security tool, such as Defender. This baseline should not be a
requirement to use Defender, but instead, as guidance for how these
requirements could be met using Defender, should an agency elect to use
Defender as their tool of choice.

In addition to these controls, agencies should consider using a Cloud
Access Security Broker to secure their environments as they adopt zero
trust principles.

## Assumptions

The agency has identified a set of user accounts that have access to sensitive and high value information.  As a result, these accounts may be at a higher risk of being targeted.  These accounts are referred to as sensitive accounts for the purposes of the Defender policies in this baseline.

The **License Requirements** sections of this document assume the
organization is using an [M365
E3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans)
or [G3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/government)
license level. Therefore, only licenses not included in E3/G3 are
listed.

# Baseline

## 1. Preset Security Profiles

Microsoft Defender defines two [preset security
profiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies):
standard and strict. These preset policies are informed by observations made by Microsoft and are designed to strike the balance between usability and security. They allow administrators to enable the full feature set of Defender by simply adding users to the policies rather than manually configuring each setting.

Within the preset policies, users can be enrolled in [Exchange Online Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/eop-about?view=o365-worldwide) and [Defender for Office 365 protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview?view=o365-worldwide), and [Impersonation Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-phishing-policies-about?view=o365-worldwide#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365) can be configured.

### Policies
#### MS.DEFENDER.1.1v1
The standard and strict preset security policies SHALL be enabled.
- _Rationale:_  Defender includes a large number of features and settings to protect users against threats. Using the preset security policies, administrators can easily ensure that all new and existing users automatically have secure defaults applied.

- _Last modified:_ June 2023
#### MS.DEFENDER.1.2v1
All users SHALL be added to Exchange Online Protection in either the standard or strict preset security policy.
- _Rationale:_ Important user protections are provided by Exchange Online Protection, including anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing protections. By using the preset policies, administrators can easily ensure that all new and existing users automatically have secure defaults applied.

- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.1.3v1
All users SHALL be added to Defender for Office 365 Protection in either the standard or strict preset security policy.
- _Rationale:_ Important user protections are provided by Defender for Office 365 Protection, including safe attachments and safe links. By using the preset policies, administrators can easily ensure that all new and existing users automatically have secure defaults applied.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.1.4v1
Sensitive accounts SHALL be added to Exchange Online Protection in the strict preset security policy.
- _Rationale:_ The increased protection offered by the strict preset policy helps mitigate the greater harm that could result from the compromise of a sensitive account.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.1.5v1
Sensitive accounts SHALL be added to Defender for Office 365 Protection in the strict preset security policy.
- _Rationale:_ The increased protection offered by the strict preset policy helps mitigate the greater harm that could result from the compromise of a sensitive account.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.1.6v1
Specific user accounts, except for sensitive accounts, MAY be exempt from the preset policies, provided that they are added to a custom policy that offers comparable protection.
- _Rationale:_ In some cases, specific users might need flexibility that is not offered by the preset policies. In these cases, these users' accounts should be added to a custom policy that conforms as closely as possible to the settings used by the preset policies (see the **Resources** section for more details).

  Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365)

### License Requirements

- N/A

### Implementation
To add users to the preset policies, follow the instructions listed under [Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to assign Standard and Strict preset security policies to users \| Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies?view=o365-worldwide#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-assign-standard-and-strict-preset-security-policies-to-users).

To apply a preset policy to all users, under "Apply protection to," select "All recipients."

## 2. Impersonation Protection
Impersonation protection checks incoming emails to see if the sender
address is similar to the users or domains on an agency-defined list. If
the sender address is significantly similar, as to indicate an
impersonation attempt, the email is quarantined.

### Policies
#### MS.DEFENDER.2.1v1
User impersonation protection SHOULD be enabled for sensitive accounts in both the standard and strict preset policies.
- _Rationale:_ User impersonation, especially the impersonation of users with access to sensitive or high value information and resources, has the potential to result in serious harm. Impersonation protection mitigates this risk. By configuring impersonation protection in both preset policies, administrators ensure that all email recipients are protected from impersonated emails, regardless of whether they are added to the standard or strict policy.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.2.2v1
Domain impersonation protection SHOULD be enabled for domains owned by the agency in both the standard and strict preset policies.
- _Rationale:_ By configuring domain impersonation protection for all agency domains, the risk of a user being deceived by a look-alike domain may be reduced. By configuring impersonation protection in both preset policies, administrators ensure that all email recipients are protected from impersonated emails, regardless of whether they are added to the standard or strict policy.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.2.3v1
Domain impersonation protection SHOULD be added for important partners in both the standard and strict preset policies.
- _Rationale:_ By configuring domain impersonation protection for domains owned by important partners, the risk of a user being deceived by a look-alike domain may be reduced. By configuring impersonation protection in both preset policies, administrators ensure that all email recipients are protected from impersonated emails, regardless of whether they are added to the standard or strict policy.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.2.4v1
Trusted senders and domains MAY be added in the event of false positives.
- _Rationale:_ It is possible that false positives may be raised by the impersonation protection system. In these cases, consider marking legitimate senders as trusted to prevent protection from flagging them in the future.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

### License Requirements

- Impersonation protection and advanced phishing thresholds require
  Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or 2. These are included with E5 and G5
  and are available as add-ons for E3 and G3. As of April 25, 2023
  anti-phishing for user and domain impersonation and spoof intelligence
  are not yet available in GCC High and DoD (see [Platform features \|
  Microsoft
  Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/office-365-us-government#platform-features)
  for current offerings).

### Implementation
To add email addresses and domains to flag when impersonated by attackers, follow the instructions listed under [Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to assign Standard and Strict preset security policies to users \| Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies?view=o365-worldwide#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-assign-standard-and-strict-preset-security-policies-to-users).

## 3. Safe Attachments

The Safe Attachments feature will scan messages for attachments with malicious
content. It routes all messages and attachments that do not have a
virus or malware signature to a special environment. It then uses machine
learning and analysis techniques to detect malicious intent.
While safe attachments for Exchange Online is automatically
configured in the preset policies, separate action needs to be taken to
enable it for other products.

### Policies
#### MS.DEFENDER.3.1v1
Safe attachments SHOULD be enabled for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.
- _Rationale:_ Users clicking malicious links makes them vulnerable to attacks. However, this danger is not limited to links included in emails. Other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Teams, can be used to present users with malicious links. As such, it is important to protect users on these other Microsoft products as well.

### License Requirements

- Requires Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or 2. These are included with
  E5 and G5 and are available as add-ons for E3 and G3.

### Implementation

To enable Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft
Teams, follow the instructions listed at [Turn on Safe Attachments for
SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams \| Microsoft
Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/turn-on-mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams?view=o365-worldwide).

1.  Sign in to [Microsoft 365
    Defender](https://security.microsoft.com/).

2.  Under **Email & collaboration**, select **Policies & rules**.

3.  Select **Threat policies**.

4.  Under **Policies**, select **Safe Attachments**.

5.  Select **Global settings**.

6.  Set **Turn on Defender for Office 365 for SharePoint, OneDrive, and
    Microsoft Teams** to on.

## 4. Data Loss Prevention

There are several approaches to secure sensitive information, such
as warning users, encryption, or blocking attempts to share. The
agencyâ€™s data loss prevention (DLP) policy will dictate what agency
information is sensitive and how that information is handled.  Defender
can detect sensitive information and associates a default confidence
level with this detection based on the sensitive information type
matched.  Confidence levels are used to reduce false positives in
detecting access to sensitive information.  Agencies may choose to use
the default confidence levels or adjust the levels in custom DLP policies
to fit their environment and needs.

### Policies
#### MS.DEFENDER.4.1v1
A custom policy SHALL be configured to protect PII and sensitive information,
as defined by the agency. At a minimum, credit card numbers, Taxpayer
Identification Numbers (TIN), and Social Security Numbers (SSN) SHALL be
blocked.
 - _Rationale:_ Users may inadvertently share sensitive information with
                others who should not have access to it.  Data loss prevention policies provide a way for agencies to detect
                and prevent unauthorized disclosures.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.2v1
The custom policy SHOULD be applied in Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams chat,
and Devices.
- _Rationale:_ Unauthorized disclosures may happen through Microsoft 365
               services or endpoint devices.  Data loss prevention
               policies should cover all affected locations to be
               effective.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.3v1
The action for the DLP policy SHOULD be set to block sharing sensitive information with everyone when DLP conditions are met.
- _Rationale:_ Access to sensitive information should be prohibited unless
               explicitly allowed.  Specific exemptions can be made based
               on agency policies and valid business justifications.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.4v1
Notifications to inform users and help educate them on the proper use of sensitive information SHOULD be enabled.
- _Rationale:_ Some users may not be aware of agency policies on the
               proper use of sensitive information.  Enabling
               notifications provides positive feedback to users when
               accessing sensitive information.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.5v1
A list of apps that are restricted when accessing files protected by DLP policy SHOULD be defined.
- _Rationale:_ Some applications may inappropriately share accessed files
               or not conform to agency policies for access to sensitive
               information.  Defining a list of those apps makes it
               possible to use DLP policies to restrict those apps access
               to sensitive information on endpoints using Defender.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.6v1
The custom policy SHOULD include an action to block access to sensitive
information by restricted apps and unwanted bluetooth applications.
- _Rationale:_ Some applications may inappropriately share accessed files
               or not conform to agency policies for access to sensitive
               information.  Defining a DLP policy with an action to block
               access from restricted apps and unwanted bluetooth applications prevents unauthorized disclosure by those
               programs.

## 6. Microsoft Purview Audit

Unified audit logging generates logs of user activity in M365 services. 
These logs are essential for conducting incident response and threat detection activity.

By default, Microsoft retains the audit logs for only 90 days. Activity
by users with E5 licenses is logged for one year. 

However, per OMB M-21-31, Microsoft 365 audit logs are to be retained at least 12 months in
active storage and an additional 18 months in cold storage. This can be
accomplished either by offloading the logs out of the cloud environment
or natively through Microsoft by creating an [audit log retention
policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/audit-log-retention-policies?view=o365-worldwide#create-an-audit-log-retention-policy).

OMB M-21-13 also requires Advanced Audit be configured in M365. Advanced Audit adds additional event types to the Unified Audit Log.
